# Praxis_Review_Tool

This project is a complete overhaul and upgrade to the original PraNes program.  The was designed for the Graduation Team at WGU and aims to reduce
the time it takes to review graduation applications that require a Praxis Exam review. THe program was developed using JDK 17 and JavaFX17.  A SQLite datebase
was used to store the data. 

Upon launch the user is taken to the main Teachers College Licensure page of the Student Handbook.  A combo box at the top of the screen will allow the user to 
either click the drop down menu to display a list of all possible states a user may need to review.  The user may also enter text in the text field to filter 
the list.  On the left hand side of the page the user can enter their initials, click a radio button to indicate if it is the first or second praxis check.
Finally the user needs to click cleared or not cleared.  This will generate the note in the correct format for the graduation team member to use for documentation.
